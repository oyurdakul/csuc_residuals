This online companion contains
1. The four [appendices](/appendix.pdf) to the manuscript. In Appendix A, we furnish the nomenclature used in the paper. Appendix B provides the detailed mathematical formulation of the unit commitment problem modeled in the publication. In Appendix C, we report the results of the one-sample two-tailed Student's t-test conducted on empirical residuals obtained using the ordinary least squares and k-nearest neighbors models. Finally, Appendix D lays out the results of the modified R/S test, carried out to substantiate the Î±-mixing assumption adopted in the publication.
